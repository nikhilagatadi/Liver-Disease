# Liver Disease Prediction Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is focused on predicting **liver disease** using machine learning techniques.  
It processes medical data, applies data preprocessing, and trains classification models to predict whether a patient is likely to have liver disease.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Implementation of multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
- Easy-to-use code structure
